# Setting up Basic Web Files

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Generate a foundational HTML boilerplate.
- Set up and link CSS files to HTML documents.
- Link JavaScript files to HTML documents and understand their execution context.

## Introduction

In this module, we will begin by setting up the essential files needed for any web development project: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will learn how to create these files from scratch, add foundational code (boilerplate) to your HTML, and prepare your project for styling and functionality enhancements. This setup is crucial as it lays the groundwork for developing and testing web applications right in your browser.

## Optional: Alternative IDE

If you haven't completed the installation process and aren't set up with a local development environment, no worries! An excellent alternative is using an online IDE like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), which will allow you to follow along with the lessons directly in your browser.

In CodePen, everything you would normally place within the `<body>` section of your HTML boilerplate corresponds to the HTML panel. CodePen simplifies the process by handling the setup for you, allowing you to focus on writing and testing your code in real-time. Don't forget to open the console tab to view your Javascript printouts.
