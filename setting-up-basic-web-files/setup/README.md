## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/coding/lectures` directory:

```bash
cd ~/coding/lectures
```

Make a new directory called `first-web-app`, then enter this directory:

```bash
mkdir first-web-app
cd first-web-app
```

Then, create three files:

- An HTML file named `index.html`
- A CSS file named `main.css`
- A Javascript file named `script.js`

> Note: You can create more than one file at the same time as follows (separate each file by a space):

```bash
touch index.html main.css script.js
```

With the files created, open the contents of the `first-web-app` directory in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```
