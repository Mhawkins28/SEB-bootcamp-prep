## 🏆 How to Succeed in SEB

"Early is on time, on time is late, and late is unacceptable!" -Eric Jerome Dickey.

### Trust the Process - The Cycle of Imitation, Repetition, & Innovation

We have a large body of knowledge, experience, and expertise to draw on from the iterative nature of SEB. Trust the the process. It may feel as though you're not "learning" enough during the lectures. This is not where you should expect to grasp the concepts in this program. In fact, the lectures will make up a relatively small part of your learning.

- ~ 30% of your understanding of the material will come from coding along with the instructor during lectures (imitation). This is the point where most students fall into the panic zone.
- ~ 40% will come from reinforcing those concepts through the deliverables and labs (repetition)
- ~ The rest of the 30% will come from building your projects (innovation)

### Be prepared to work hard, very hard

- The title says it all. Outside of regular class hours, you will spend many hours on homework assignments and projects. The most successful students in the past are ones who invest additional hours outside of class time into the course. The instructors are your biggest cheerleaders and will provide support, but we cannot do the work for you.

### Cooperation & Teamwork

- You'll be learning, eating, growing, failing, and succeeding **together** for the next 12 weeks.
- Teamwork will be paramount to your success as an SEB student and beyond. Programming is a teamwork-driven profession. You will learn more from each other than from the instructors!

### Re-learning how to learn

- The **MOST** significant skill you will gain from this course is not proficiency in a particular web framework or programming language, but rather learning how to teach yourself.
- You will learn this in an environment that is specifically tailored to this goal, where there is heavy support, instruction designed to structure your self-learning process, and safety to 'fail'.
- We will progressively "back off" over the course of the cohort, encouraging the development of your autonomy as a developer, allowing you to stand strong on your own. We refer to this as the **_gradual release of responsibility_**.

### You will be uncomfortable, regularly

- Don't be too hard on yourself.
- You will probably feel somewhat lost on this week's topic, feel more comfortable with last week's lessons, and notice that a few weeks ago looks easy.
- The first couple days would mostly be review, but we're going to ramp up the rigor and difficulty of the course slowly but surely!
- The pace of this course is designed to push you past your limits.
- The brain is like a muscle; sometimes it gets sore.
- Struggling with the material doesn't mean you aren't learning; on the contrary, it reflects sustained and meaningful engagement with the material.

### Balance

- This intensity means that we have to make room for balance.
- Sleep, food, hydration, rest, and hygiene.

![I was told there would be sleep](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ehenNuS9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ken191h31mp562g66c2w.jpg)

> Consider making a daily schedule for yourself to prioritize what's important to you - time spent with loved ones, working out, preparing healthy meals, etc. Find a balance between the hard work needed for this course and taking care of yourself.

### The Emotional Cycle of Change

![Emotional Cycle of Change](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/f4/fa/3cf4faeb2078f4f4fbb9265444bde2e0.jpg)

Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence and being open to failure. It's about knowing when to climb from the bottom of the cycle and being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it. AND I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."

### There's no winning or losing

- This is a non-competitive environment.
- **You get out what you put in.**
- Everyone enters and leaves at different levels. Try to compare you with you _only_.
- Use your classmates' work as inspiration to improve your own!

### Embrace failure

- Here we learn by doing, and things don't always (and usually won't) go right the first time.
- This is normal. Expect it.
- Fail often and learn from it.

### Over-communicate

- **ASK QUESTIONS!!!**
- If you need to be off-camera, if you didn't complete a deliverable, or if you will be late or absent, make sure to communicate with your instructional team! Treat this program as your job. If you don't, we won't be able to help you get a job.
- If you are having an issue, don't hestitate to ask for assistance. If necessary the instructional team can assist you individually during office hours/lab time, but generally, when you ask for help during lessons, you are helping everyone! Debugging is an _absolutely essential skill_ in software engineering. Pausing a lecture to debug provides everyone in the cohort the opportunity to practice this skill.
- Complete the exit tickets. SEB has been refined and improved through hundreds of cohorts. We have developed a solid curriculum and approach to delivering the material that has been informed by all of our past cohorts, but we also know that each cohort and individual is unique. Your feedback is essential to shaping this program in **realtime**.

## 📈 Growth Mindset

[Dr. Carol Dweck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck)

[Developing growth mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ)

> How do you think GROWTH MINDSET could come into play for a bootcamp student?

This may be the most mentally challenging thing you've ever done - the first time you've been bad at something in a long time. You will fail and struggle at times, but that's important. We don't succeed despite challenges - we succeed because of challenges.

The **growth mindset** here is understanding that even when something doesn't work, it will still make you a better coder! We want this to be challenging for you because...

- Just memorizing stuff won't help you. Learning **HOW** to code will.
- You can't BS your way through code.
- The fundamental standard of programming: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
- Google is your best friend.
- Unfortunately, this can hurt. Just like exercise can make you sore and tired, so should learning. Try to enjoy the burn knowing it is making you better.
- We anticipate that you will run into hardships. When you do, that's when it is time to really challenge yourself and buckle down. Don't quit! Embrace the fact that the challenge will make you a better coder. Endure the struggle to grow and develop your mind.
- A great way to track your progress and growth is by keeping a [coding journal](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/become-better-coder-keeping-programming-journal/).

Throughout the course of SEB many students say something along the lines of "I don't know how to do that." Many of you certainly will. If you do, however, just add "...yet" to the end of that sentence.
